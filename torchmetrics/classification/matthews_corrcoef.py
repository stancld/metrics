class MatthewsCorrCoef(Metric):
    r"""
    Calculates `Matthews correlation coefficient`_ that measures
    the general correlation or quality of a classification. In the binary case it
    is defined as:

    .. math::
        MCC = \frac{TP*TN - FP*FN}{\sqrt{(TP+FP)*(TP+FN)*(TN+FP)*(TN+FN)}}

    where TP, TN, FP and FN are respectively the true postitives, true negatives,
    false positives and false negatives. Also works in the case of multi-label or
    multi-class input.

    Note:
        This metric produces a multi-dimensional output, so it can not be directly logged.

    Forward accepts

    - ``preds`` (float or long tensor): ``(N, ...)`` or ``(N, C, ...)`` where C is the number of classes
    - ``target`` (long tensor): ``(N, ...)``

    If preds and target are the same shape and preds is a float tensor, we use the ``self.threshold`` argument
    to convert into integer labels. This is the case for binary and multi-label probabilities.

    If preds has an extra dimension as in the case of multi-class scores we perform an argmax on ``dim=1``.

    Args:
        num_classes: Number of classes in the dataset.
        threshold:
            Threshold value for binary or multi-label probabilites.
        compute_on_step:
            Forward only calls ``update()`` and return None if this is set to False.
        dist_sync_on_step:
            Synchronize metric state across processes at each ``forward()``
            before returning the value at the step.
        process_group:
            Specify the process group on which synchronization is called.
        dist_sync_fn:
            Callback that performs the allgather operation on the metric state. When ``None``, DDP
            will be used to perform the allgather

    Example:
        >>> from torchmetrics import MatthewsCorrCoef
        >>> target = torch.tensor([1, 1, 0, 0])
        >>> preds = torch.tensor([0, 1, 0, 0])
        >>> matthews_corrcoef = MatthewsCorrCoef(num_classes=2)
        >>> matthews_corrcoef(preds, target)
        tensor(0.5774)
